# What is TeknoParrot?

[TeknoParrot](https://teknoparrot.com/) developed by Teknogods (Well-renowned with their Call Of Duty emulators), allows you to run "selected" modern arcade titles on your own PC. Additionally, it has full support for keyboard and mouse, gamepads, steering wheels and joysticks.

While TeknoParrot is a closed-source project, they also released 2 opensource project called "[OpenParrot](https://github.com/teknogods/OpenParrot)" and "[TeknoParrotUI](https://github.com/teknogods/TeknoParrotUI)", open-source version of TeknoParrot and GUI for both project, respectively.

To begin with, download all the required files under **Requirements**"**. You can also choose to download either the English patched dump or the clean japanese dump. However, i would recommend you download the English patched dump. The english translation are based on the international version of WMMT5.

### Step 1:
Extract **TeknoParrot** and your downloaded **WMMT5 dump** to your preferrable location.
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/15VG151.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/15VG151.png" >}}

### Step 2:
Download **WMMT 5 Resolution Patch** and extract it into your **WMMT5 dump**.
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/FWO9p2M.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/FWO9p2M.png" title="Headover to github and download" >}}
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/YTfOyQl.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/YTfOyQl.png" title="Extract it to your dump" >}}

### Step 3:
Run **WMMT 5 Resolution Patcher.exe** and browse into your WMMT5 dump to select **wmn5r.exe**. A window will popup which allows you to select your **screen resolution** (Mine is 2560x1080). Once done, click **apply**.

{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/Lrny22O.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/Lrny22O.png" title="Select your monitor resolution" >}}

### Step 4:
Open your TeknoParrot folder and run **TeknoParrotUi.exe**. TeknoParrot Updater may popup upon launching. Please do download all the updates before proceeding. You may need to restart TeknoParrot after updating.
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/ZLRNr45.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/ZLRNr45.png" >}}

### Step 5:
Once the update is done, a window will inform you that no games are set up. Click **Yes**, scroll downwards and **add WMMT5**.
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/oLWrPeX.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/oLWrPeX.png" title="Yes all the way!" >}}
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/hY52ors.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/hY52ors.png" title="Add WMMT5" >}}

### Step 6:
Next, Click on **Game Settings**. Once again, under Game Executable, select **wmn5r.exe**. Additionally, Tick **General-XInput** and possibly **General-WhiteScreenFix** too. You can also setup your in-game with **General-CustomName**. X-Input allows the use of Xbox 360 controllers. WhiteScreenFix fixed the game problem when you tried to Alt+Tab. Finally, click **Save Settings**.

If the Terminal crashes after selecting your WMMT5 directory or on start, delete all the videos inside "Video" folder.

The Terminal also works in offline mode too!

# WMMT5 Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

### 1. Help, my game is running slow despite having a good Nvidia graphic card.
This is possibly due to your system using Integrated graphics by default. To fix this, do the following: 

1. Right click anywhere in your desktop and select **NVIDIA Control Panel** 
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/OdbKJTw.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/OdbKJTw.png" >}}
 
2. Go to **Program Settings**, click Add and choose **wmn5r.exe**
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/GyB045j.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/GyB045j.png" >}}
3. Be sure to choose "High-performance NVIDIA processor" as your preferred graphics processor.
{{< image classes="fancybox" src="https://i.imgur.com/t70rJBz.png" thumbnail="https://i.imgur.com/t70rJBz.png" >}} 

### 2. How do i save my car if there is no Banapassport?
At the end of a race, there will be a selection to either continue the game or not. Selecting "No" will save your car progress. 

Cars are saved inside your WMMT5 dump directory at "OpenParrot_Cars". Do use Wangan Terminal Project 2.0 for dress-up.

### 3. Why does the story start from the last progress?
Despite using other cars, the game progression will always be the last completed mission. This is due to the Story mode being saved in a single file, located inside WMMT5 dump directory as "openprogress.sav".

To restart Story mode, delete "openprogress.sav".

### 3. Where is Ghost mode?
Currently, there is no Ghost mode. However, progress has been made to enable Ghost mode. For further progress, do check out [WMMT5 Online Ghost Project](http://derole.co.uk/wmmt5ghostbattle/).
