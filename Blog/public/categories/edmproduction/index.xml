      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is part 5 of the series on &amp;ldquo;Thinking Inside the Box: A Complete EQ Tutorial&amp;rdquo; were authored by the user “hipnotic”  (Steve Mercer) and originally hosted and rehosted at the now defunct dnbscene.com &amp;amp; apexaudio.org respectively. I think this is the best well-explained EQ tutorial ever made, it would be a shame for it to go to waste. I hope readers will benefit from this guide. There are slight differences from the original article.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
