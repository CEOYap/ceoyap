I've finally graduated from university! Time to use my spare time developing this game. Onwards to the new update, i've finally added all the heroes from DOTA 2 with all the required stats. It's now in a playable state but it still require some serious work on the stats.

Beside that, i've made a new design to the card and created a website specifically for "[DOTA2-CCG](https://ceoyap.github.io/D2CCG.htm)", which can also be accessed from the sidebar menu.

With the recent release of Unreal Engine 4.16, the game has been fully updated to the latest game engine and thankfully, nothing broke. A minor update to the game is that the game are now based on Radiant vs Dire but there are no restriction on the heroes selection. Beside that, the ruleset of the game may change as to make it unique to the DOTA UNIVERSE.

# All heroes added

All the heroes have finally been added, including Monkey King! Though, i am yet to add those sub-units like spiderlings, wind spirit, fire spirit, and etc as those will also be part of the cards special abilities.

The card stats can be seen [here](https://ceoyap.github.io/D2CCG.htm). After releasing the pre-alpha version of the game, maybe i can do some serious balancing on the stats based on community feedback.

# New Card Design

![sexy card](http://i.imgur.com/Pcn02ga.png "NEW FUCKING DESIGN")

The new design are based on Dota 2 7.00 Website with some minor tweaks. In addition to that, I've also added a disclaimer note on the footer of the card. In the future, i may change the health, mana and attack icon as it doesn't suit the theme. The fonts has also been replaced from Lobster 1.5 to [TRAJAN](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/trajan/), which is part of [DOTA2 Official font](https://pastebin.com/raw/bSK4cFYr).

# Designing Menu and Battleground

The picture above is a rough concept of the battleground that the players are going to play in, with all the assets from DOTA 2 Source 1 as i am unable to find the latest files from the new engine.

# Closing thoughts

Completing the game and releasing a pre-alpha version of the game takes time due to the fact the game is currently missing a ton of important features such as sounds, abilities and networking function. I will also be making a roadmap using trello which can be accessed by the public.

Another thought i have is that i may add characters from the old DOTA 1 which are removed or even huge MOBA games such as League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm, once the game has been complete.
