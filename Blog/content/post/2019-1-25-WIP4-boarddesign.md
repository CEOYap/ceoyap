I am pretty sure you guys are excited with these latest update on the game. I finally completed the map! Wooohooo!
<!--more-->
[Artifact](https://store.steampowered.com/app/583950/Artifact/) is finally out on Steam and people are downright furious with the game. Lorewise the game is great, but the amount of money needed to play the game are straightup insane! I seriously can't wait for that game to go Free-to-play. I mean, the game is so bad that it ended up [out of Steam Top 100](https://www.githyp.com/valves-artifact-ended-2018-outside-steams-top-100-most-played-games/) games in 2018!.

# Minor updates

The game is now known as DoKad 2, with a hard "K" and currently uses Unreal Engine v4.20, as latest version of Unreal Engine has a huge download size. Nonetheless, the map has been completed and it is much better than the initial version.

Additionally, the game has an AI now to enable singleplayer mode. Multiplayer has already been implemented in the game, however no matchmaking system is currently available. Therefore, you need to portforward(except for LAN) and use IP address to connect other people's game. If the game do gain traction in the future, i would consider implementing a matchmaking system.

Heroes has also been divided into Strength, Intelligence and Agility, instead of Dota 2. This implementation shall not affect future added heroes from other universes (i.e League of Legends, and Heroes of the Storm). Latest heroes such as Pangolier, Dark Willow and Grimstroke will be added in the future as soon as core features are done.

### TL;DR:

* Game is now known as DoKad 2

* Game updated to Unreal Engine 4.20

* Singleplayer available

* No matchmaking system (i.e Steamworks)

* Heroes categorised on attributes, instead of Universes (i.e Dota 2, LoL)

* Latest heroes not available yet

# The Battleground is finally complete!

The map uses asset from Dota 2 Source 1 engine and Synty Studios. I will soon upload the Dota 2 Source 1 assets for use. Thanks to the low poly count, low spec computers will be able to play the game at its maximum framerate

Do click on the images to zoom in.

### Version 1:
This version shows the basic design of the map by using assets from Dota 2. You may notice that some objects have been removed in the final version as they are known to block players view.

### Version 2:
This final version of the board can be played from start to finish without any visual bugs/glitches. However, there are certain things that needed to be fix including the borders of card placement, and position of the cards.

# Closing thoughts

With the gameboard now complete, my next task is to add a new mainmenu and sounds to the game. Soon after, i will have to change the stats of every single heroes and add unique abilities. I also intend to add some bonus features or "clickables" to the board, as seen in Hearthstone gameboard.

Unfortunately, i can only spare a few minutes on developing this game. Therefore, i am not able to provide any release date. Fret not! You guys shall be the first person to know the game release date! 

Finally, thank you for following my journey in developing DoKad 2. I believe this game will be much fun, if not, better than Artifact.
