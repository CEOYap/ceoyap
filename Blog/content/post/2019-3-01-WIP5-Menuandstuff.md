A month has passed and a new development update for DoKad 2!
<!--more-->

# Working mainmenu! Woohoo!

The mainmenu for DoKad 2 has been built from scratch and it really need a UI upgrade, which is already in my to-do list. I've included multiplayer widgets into the mainmenu to reduce CPU usage, because the [blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Blueprints) i've made seems to create a new process within Unreal Engine as a new widget is opened. Additionally, the game engine has been fully updated to v4.21 without any issues.

LAN networking is fully working, however, i am having trouble with the in-game UI, to show "Awaiting player to join". The game instantly spawn an AI. To overcome this problem, launching either "Singleplayer" or "Multiplayer" game will show options to either wait for a player to join or spawn an AI. Furtheremore, there are a selection of UIs that i have to fix which includes "Deck Selection", which has UI size problem, "Game Options", and "Deck Builder".

UI aside, the game is currently working as intended. However, the gameplay is too similar to Hearthstone and i intend to implement a few mechanics from [Dota AutoChess](https://dotaautochess.gamepedia.com/Dota_Auto_Chess_Wiki), a feature i would love to include is combining "2" similar cards into a more powerful card.

Do checkout DoKad 2 developmental progress through [Trello](https://trello.com/b/T8QKU19Y/dokad-2-a-dota-2-card-game).

### TL;DR:

* A working mainmenu and loading screen

* Game updated to Unreal Engine 4.21

* Direct connect and LAN networking

* Game Options, Deck Selection, Deck Builder not done yet

* Possibility of adding Dota Auto Chess upgrading mechanics

* Follow progress through [Trello](https://trello.com/b/T8QKU19Y/dokad-2-a-dota-2-card-game)

# Closing thoughts

In my honest opinion, i can totally release the pre-alpha version of the game at this stage. However, there are some issues that have to be solved. I will have a network and gameplay test from Aus with my peeps in Ireland as soon as i complete the in-game UI/UX, which will take forever cause i tend to procrastinate a lot!

I am currently working on a few projects which i could monetise to help support my current study in Sydney. I recently made a synthwave track to include into the latest Progresif Locals Only: EDM album. 

Furthermore, i am currently working on a survivor horror game roughly based on [SCP Foundation](http://www.scp-wiki.net/). I will soon annouce this project on a later date once i have confidence with the map i am currently prototyping for the game.
