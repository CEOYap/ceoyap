I am writing this to late you guys know that i am still working on the game but lately the progress has been really slow as i have exam starting 1st May.
<!--more-->

Either way, i got the game to function as intended and found out that it's possible to copy-paste card infos and stats so this will ease and fasten my work. So i now, i've managed to add 40 new playable cards to the game.

# Closing thoughts

Once all the card details have been added to the game, the next planned update will be on the battleground design.
