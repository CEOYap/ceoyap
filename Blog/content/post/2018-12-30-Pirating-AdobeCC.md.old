I've finally graduated from university! Time to use my spare time developing this game. Onwards to the new update, i've finally added all the heroes from DOTA 2 with all the required stats. It's now in a playable state but it still require some serious work on the stats.
<!--more-->
Beside that, i've made a new design to the card and created a website specifically for "[DOTA2-CCG](https://ceoyap.github.io/D2CCG.htm)", which can also be accessed from the sidebar menu.

With the recent release of Unreal Engine 4.16, the game has been fully updated to the latest game engine and thankfully, nothing broke. A minor update to the game is that the game are now based on Radiant vs Dire but there are no restriction on the heroes selection. Beside that, the ruleset of the game may change as to make it unique to the DOTA UNIVERSE.

1. Hold down the **Windows key** on your keyboard, and tap **R**.

3. Go to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Adobe\CommonFiles\UsageCC\<user GUID>` (if you can't find your user GUID, just look in all the folders there)

4. On the right hand side, **if you do not already see a key called `optin`**, right click on a blank space there, click on ***New >*** then click on ***DWORD (32-bit) Value***.

5. Enter `optin`

6. Right click on the entry **(Start from this step if you already see the `optin` entry)**

7. Click ***Modify...***

8. Replace any value there with `0`.

9. Click ***OK***.

10. The error should no longer appear on next shutdown / restart. You do not need to restart your PC immediately.

#### ***Can I combine this with a legitimate subscription to some apps?***

- **Absolutely.** Just don't add the hosts (skip the whole section). Everything else will work flawlessly, the disabling of services / registry editing has no effect on the Adobe apps, pirated or legitimately obtained.

- If you wish to use the Creative Cloud file storage, **keep the Adobe Creative Cloud App installed**, but don't open it (if you do, and some apps lose activation, just repatch - its an easy fix). Disable it from running on startup.

#### ***Should I use AMTEmu (the activator built into CCMaker) over other tools such as Universal Adobe Patcher?***

- AMTEmu **patches and completely strips away** the DRM from the Adobe application it cracks, meanwhile Universal Adobe Patcher **only patches it**. This translates into a performance boost as there is no longer any DRM running in the background. 

- **[Here](https://i.imgur.com/mGPUkFV.png)** is a representation of it. The left one (AMT) is benchmarked from a legitimate Adobe application activated with a real license (identical performance to UAP) and the right one is AMTEmu.

#### ***Are these hosts up to date?***

- The text file with the hosts I **[linked](https://pastebin.com/raw/Mpm5Jd6m)** is verified and updated for 2018 courtesy of u/Greywinde **[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Piracy/comments/8fy5id/adobe_domains_that_need_to_be_blocked_in_hosts/)**.
